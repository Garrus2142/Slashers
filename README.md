#### Welcome to Slashers, the ultimate horror movie gamemode by Utopia-Games.

Slashers is an asymetrical gamemode based on many famous horror movies (especially slasher movies) that opposes a team of very cliché survivors against a powerful and scary killer.
As a survivor you have to find jerrycans to fill the generator then turn on the radio to call the police and finally escape.
As the killer, you have to kill all the survivors before they can escape.
The spawn of every ressource is random at each game.

![Characters](http://utopia-games.net/medias/slashers/characters.png)

Each character is different and has a special ability that will help him survive or kill the others :


**Survirors:**
* _Trent (the jock)_ : has a very good stamina, can run away easily from the killer.
* _Lynda (the popular girl)_ : is notified of the police arrival and its position.
* _Sydney (the final girl)_ : is immuned to the killers main ability.
* _Audrey (the emo)_ : is immuned to fear and her heartbeat can't be heard by the killer.
* _Marty (the junky)_ : has a better vision that helps him seeing in the dark.
* _Noah (the nerd)_ : has a detector that spot every living things nearby.
* _Rolland (the black that dies first)_ : has keys that allow him to lock and unlock doors.
* _Franklin (the fat guy)_ : is the strongest and has more health.
* _Gale (the skeptical cop)_ : has a revolver that can stun the killer.

**Killers:**
* _Ghostface (Scream)_ : can see when a door is opened or closed nearby.
* _Jason (Friday the 13th)_ : can see the recent footprints left by the survivors.
* _Michael Myers (Halloween)_ : is slower but can spot a survivor until he's dead.
* _the Proxy (Slender)_ : can appear and disapper when not visible by a survivor.
* _the Intruder (You're Next)_ : can place many traps to track down and kill survivors.

There are actually five maps working with the gamemode, each one has its own killer associated :

![What's Next](http://utopia-games.net/medias/slashers/next.png)

Many maps and killers are planned by the team, here's what is actually being worked on :

* *slash\_farm* : a map based on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise, coming with the Leatherface killer.
* *slash\_abandoned* : a map based on the Saw franchise, coming with the Jigsaw killer.
* weapons for the survivors to defend themselves against the killer.

As you can see, we have MANY ideas for the future maps and killers, but you can make suggestions in the comments too !

![Important](http://utopia-games.net/medias/slashers/important.png)

* 10 players is a MAXIMUM, you can't open a server with more slots or you will break the gamemode.
* You can ONLY play on the official maps, if you want to convert an existing map for the gamemode, contact Steinman and leave a comment on his profile.
* The gamemode was made with the goal of being as scary as possible, adding addons like Pointshop could totally break the immersion and atmosphere.
* Want to make a custom map for the gamemode ? Feel free to contact Steinman by leaving a comment on his profile.
* Don't reupload the gamemode anywhere, this is the only link you need to be up to date.
* This gamemode is absolutely free, don't try to make money by selling this gamemode or a modified version.
* The gamemode will be updated regularly, we have A LOT of ideas to make it live a very long time.
